    "This theory began to develop in the early ninth century and by the early twentieth century it had become what we study today. The fuel for its development was the need to explore infinity. For example, there was hope for the study of prime numbers at infinity. But no one proposed anything beyond Riemann's research. We still do not know what algorithm is used to create prime numbers. All digital security, by the way, is built on this ignorance. That is, we are deliberately creating a system that could collapse with the development of mathematics.\n",

The symbol $\\vee$ inside a curly bracket is called __\"disjunction\"__ , which is as close as possible to an \"or\" conjunction (logical sum). For example, the union of segments $[1,3]$ and $[2,7]$ is the segment $[1,7]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Intersection__. For any two sets $A,B\\subset U$, define an intersection $A\\cap B =\\{c\\in U \\,\\,|\\,\\, (c\\in A)\\wedge(c\\in B)\\}$. The symbol $\\wedge$ inside a curly bracket is called a __\"conjunction\"__, which is as close as possible to an \"and\" conjunction (logical product). For example, the intersection of segments $[1,3]$ and $[2,7]$ is the segment $[2,3]$.\n",

    "5. __Symmetric difference__. For any two sets $A,B\\subset U$, define symmetric difference $A\\Delta B =\\{c\\in U \\,\\,|\\,\\, (c\\in A)\\oplus (c\\in B)\\}$. The symbol $\\oplus$ inside a curly bracket has many names. We will call it __excluding \"or\"__, also called modulo 2 addition, XOR, strict disjunction, per-digit addition, mask inversion, zhegalkin addition, logical subtraction, logical unequivalence. For example, the symmetric difference of segments $[1,3]$ and $[2,7]$ is the union of two segments $[1,2)\\cup(3,7]$, not including 2 and 3.\n",

    "### The axiomatics of operations on statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Negation__. The logical operation corresponding to the logical conjunction \"not\" is called negation. This operation results in a statement that is false if the original statement is true, and true if the original statement is false. It is called $\\overline A$ or $\\neg A$ and reads \"not $A$\". For example, if $A$ is the statement \"the mathematical statement is proved\", then the statement \"the mathematical statement is not proved\" is denoted by $\\overline A$. The correspondence between statements is defined by truth tables. In our case this table has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$\\overline A$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Disjunction__. The disjunction operation applies to two statements $A$ and $B$ and corresponds to joining them with the union \"or\". It is denoted by $A || B$ or $A\\vee B$ or $A+B$ (read: $A$ or $B$). For example, \"A contract may be made orally or in writing\". The disjunction of two statements $A$ and $B$ will be false if and only if both statements are false. Therefore, the truth table for a disjunction has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A\\vee B$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __ Conjunction__. The conjunction operation applies to two statements $A$ and $B$ and corresponds to joining them with an \"and\" conjunction. It is denoted by $A\\, \\&\\& \\,B$ or $A\\wedge B$ or $A\\cdot B$ (read: $A$ and $B$). For example, \"He is my fellow traveller and friend\". The conjunction of two statements $A$ and $B$ will be true if and only if both statements are true. Therefore, the truth table for a conjunction has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A\\wedge B$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are the basic operations. Consider the additional ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Excluding \"or\"__. The operation excluding \"or\" applies to two statements $A$ and $B$. It is denoted by $A$ (read: $A$-excluding \"or\" $B$). For example: \"Either get it or get it\". This statement is true only when only one of the elementary statements is true. The truth table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A\\oplus B$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Implication__. The implication operation corresponds to the union of two statements using the union \"if $A$ , then $B$\". It is denoted by $A\\rightarrow B$. For example, \"If a contract student has received only excellent grades for 2 sessions, the dean's office may transfer him/her to a state-financed form of study on his/her application\". The implication of two statements $A$ and $B$ is false if and only if statement $A$ is true and $B$ is false. Statement $A$ is the premise of the implication, and statement $B$ is the consequence. The truth table looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A\\rightarrow B$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "It should be clarified that logical operations do not take into account in any way the meaning of the statements involved in them. Statements are regarded as objects with the sole property of being true or false. For example: Let $X$: \"The moon is made of green cheese\", and $U$: \"2+2=5\", then according to the table since $X$ is false, then the implication $X\\rightarrow U$ will be true, although there is no connection in sense between $X$ and $U$. Similarly, if $U$ is \"2+2=4\", then $X\\rightarrow Y$ is true, regardless of whether \"The moon is made of green cheese\" and \"2+2=4\" are related. This clarification of the implication \"If $X$, then $U$\" does not contradict common sense. For example, the promise __\"If I get a bicycle, I'll let you ride it\" is only perceived as a lie if I was given a bicycle, but I did not give it a ride.__\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. __Equivalence__. Equivalence is denoted by $A\\leftrightarrow B$ (read: $A$ is equivalent to $B$ or $A$ is equivalent to $B$ or $A$ if and only if $B$). For example, \"An even number is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by 3\" or \"A student is admitted to a session if and only if he passes all his credits\". An equivalence of two statements $A$ and $B$ is true if and only if the truths of the statements coincide. Therefore, the table of truths for an equivalence has the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "<table>\n",
    "<thead>\n",
    "<tr><th>$A$</th><th>$B$</th><th>$A\\leftrightarrow B$</th></tr>\n",
    "</thead>\n",
    "<tbody>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$0$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$0$</td><td>$0$</td></tr>\n",
    "    <tr><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td><td>$1$</td></tr>\n",
    "</tbody>\n",
    "</table>\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that equivalence and exclusionary \"or\" have opposite meanings. This is where one of the names of the exclusive \"or\" comes from - logical unequivalence."
