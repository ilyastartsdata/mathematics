## Installing / Getting started

### Getting started with Google Colab

#### What is Colaboratory?

Colaboratory, or "Colab" for short, allows you to write and execute Python in your browser, with 
- Zero configuration required
- Free access to GPUs
- Easy sharing

Whether you're a **student**, a **data scientist** or an **AI researcher**, Colab can make your work easier. Watch [Introduction to Colab](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=inN8seMm7UI) to learn more, or just get started below.

#### Getting started

The document you are reading is not a static web page, but an interactive environment called a **Colab notebook** that lets you write and execute code.

To execute the code in the above cell, select it with a click and then either press the play button to the left of the code, or use the keyboard shortcut "Command/Ctrl+Enter". To edit the code, just click the cell and start editing.

Variables that you define in one cell can later be used in other cells.

Colab notebooks allow you to combine **executable code** and **rich text** in a single document, along with **images**, **HTML**, **LaTeX** and more. When you create your own Colab notebooks, they are stored in your Google Drive account. You can easily share your Colab notebooks with co-workers or friends, allowing them to comment on your notebooks or even edit them. To learn more, see [Overview of Colab](/notebooks/basic_features_overview.ipynb). To create a new Colab notebook you can use the File menu above, or use the following link: [create a new Colab notebook](http://colab.research.google.com#create=true).

Colab notebooks are Jupyter notebooks that are hosted by Colab. To learn more about the Jupyter project, see [jupyter.org](https://www.jupyter.org).
